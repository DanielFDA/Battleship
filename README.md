## Overview 

For my first project in General Assembly's Software Engineering course our task was to develop a game within a week using HTML, CSS and Javascript, we were given a few options of which I chose the Battleship game.

Battleship is a strategy-guessing game made for two players. Both players have a grid with their fleets made of 4 or 5 ships that are concealed to each other. The objective of the game is to destroy each others fleet for which the players alternate turns calling shots at the other player's grid

## Setup

First we need to download the repository into our own machine:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/DanielFDA/sei-project-1.git
```

then, to launch the game go the downloaded folder and double-click `index.html`

For this game there is no installation or requirements needed.

## Technologies Used
* VS Code
* Git
* GitHub
* CSS
* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5

## Notable Bugs

These were the most important bugs I found while testing the game

#### Sunk Ships Message
The message displayed on the screen stops updating after a certain amount of lives taken from the ships

#### Ships generation
No ship is ever auto-generated on the first column

## Conclusion

### Wins and Challenges
After three weeks of coding I went into my first project with quite a few doubts but very anxious to see what I would be able to develop within a week. So I kept the scope pretty simple to begin with taking into account that this was the first time that I would work on a project (plus being alone).

Making the function to control the turns with the AI actions happening right after the player's input was the most difficult


### Some Learnings

Since this was my first time developing a game, I had some trouble deciding where I should start and felt a little overwhelmed at first but thanks to the coaching and instructions given by the team at GA I started by picturing how I wanted my game to work and began making functions for the very basic things I needed like creating the grid for both the player and AI and placing ships inside randomly for both, then moving onto the more complex functions that would take care of the gameplay and both the player's and AI's inputs.

This methodologie helped me understand how to split big problems into smaller and manageable pieces that I can begin to work on in order to achieve a certain goal. At the end, despite the fact that I couldn't finish what I set myself to do, I was satisfied with the outcome and the fact that I enjoyed developing this game while learning a lot
